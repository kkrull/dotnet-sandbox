# .NET Sandbox

Sandbox monorepo to try things out in the .NET ecosystem.

This repository is first organized by the broad version of .NET is being used
(e.g. it distinguishes .NET Core from .NET 6 and beyond).

As with my other "sandbox" repositories, each directory here is its own,
self-contained project.  Look for code and documentation in those directories,
to learn more.
